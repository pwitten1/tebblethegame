# tebblethegame

This is our React Native game for Computer Science 333 at Princeton University. Please feel free to take a look at our work!

We consulted a Tetris game when building this project, and borrow heavily from its structure and approach. That game can be found here: https://github.com/ggomaeng/react-native-tetris

Many thanks, Sung Woo Park!
